# DemoAdaPhysics2D

This is a simple demo of AdaPhysics2D for the STM32F429

Made with the help of AdaCore's Ada_Drivers_Library

## Demos
This demonstrates the collisions, different materials, Archimede's principle, gravity, and displays the use of a spring (that was then called a rope)

This demonstrates ropes and springs, with the new physics and rendering
